# Cyber Heist
Introductory lab for UAF Cyber Security Club (CSC) Fall 2019

## Introduction
Welcome to CSC! Today you will be 'hacking' into some insecure programs and Raspberry Pi controlled internet of things (IoT) devices. There will be a prize for the first person to reach the end, however, the prize only applies to first time members. If you are a returning member, we will keep track of when you finish and award the top 3 with something different at a later time... :)

## Rules and Guidelines
* Do not intentionally break or lock people out of devices
  * If we catch you doing this intentionally, you will be disqualified - no worries if it's a mistake :)
* You may only edit code that is saved on your VM. Code on the Raspberry Pis DOES NOT need to be edited and you will accomplish nothing by doing so.
* You may work in groups, but prizes will be distributed to only one person. You must decide who in your group gets the prize.
  * Feel free to work together! This is highly encouraged for new members!
  
## Hints
* There are multiple ways to solve each challenge, use your imagination and creativity!
* Answers you find in one challenge might be used in the future. Keep track of your findings :D
* Tristan, Ryan, Bradley, and Matt will be available to assist with questions. Don't be afraid to ask anyone anything, this is a friendly environment!
